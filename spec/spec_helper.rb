# Testing Conventions
#
# File organization:
#   - One spec file per script, named to match: <script-name>_spec.rb
#     (e.g. dependency_spec.rb for dependency.lic, pick_spec.rb for pick.lic)
#
# Principles:
#   - DAMP (Descriptive And Meaningful Phrases): favor readable, self-documenting
#     test names and setup over extreme DRYness. Each test should be understandable
#     in isolation without chasing helper definitions.
#   - SOLID: extract shared behavior into shared_examples when the same assertions
#     apply across multiple contexts. Use let/before for setup, not deep inheritance.
#     Keep each test focused on a single responsibility.
#
# Lich runtime isolation:
#   - Scripts (.lic files) cannot be required directly -- they depend on the full
#     Lich runtime. Extract just the unit under test via eval of specific line
#     ranges with one of the load_lic_* helpers defined below: load_lic_class /
#     load_lic_module for a class or module body, load_lic_constant for a
#     single-line constant, or load_lic_methods for the top-level defs of a
#     class-less script (returned wrapped in a module).
#
# Shared game doubles -- READ THIS before adding or copying a spec:
#   The game/commons layer is stubbed ONCE, centrally, so the whole suite can run
#   in a single process without specs clobbering each other's doubles. Follow
#   these rules or you WILL reintroduce order-dependent failures (a duplicate
#   top-level definition wins for the entire process by load order, so a stub
#   added in one spec silently changes another spec that ran first or last):
#
#   - Game objects (DRStats, DRSkill, DRSpells, DRRoom, GameObj, Flags, Room,
#     Map, Script, XMLData, EquipmentManager), the commons command modules (DRC,
#     DRCI, DRCC, DRCM, DRCT, DRCH, DRCA, DRCS, DRCMM, DRCTH) and Lich all live
#     in test/test_harness.rb. Do NOT redefine or reopen them in a spec file
#     (no `module DRC ... end`).
#   - To change what a stub returns for one example, override it there with
#     `allow(DRC).to receive(:bput).and_return(...)` -- never by reopening the
#     module. `allow` adds the method even if the harness lacks it.
#   - Harness default returns follow these conventions -- they are heuristics,
#     not guarantees, so check test/test_harness.rb for the exact value:
#       * presence / "did it happen" predicates (in_hands?, exists?) -> false
#       * "did the action succeed" checks (get_item?, cast_spell?, walk_to) -> true
#       * collection / count accessors -> [] / 0 / {}
#         (e.g. get_item_list -> [], count_* -> 0, get_total_wealth -> {})
#       * most other methods -> nil (an inert seam)
#     Some methods return domain values instead of nil -- notably
#     DRC.bput -> 'Roundtime' and DRCH.check_health -> a health Hash -- so do not
#     assume nil for a method you have not checked.
#   - Need a commons method the harness does not have yet? Add it to
#     test/test_harness.rb following the conventions above -- do not stub it
#     locally in one spec.
#   - UserVars is a generic dynamic store in the harness: any getter reads back
#     nil until set, any setter stores, and it is cleared before each example.
#     Override a key with allow(UserVars).to receive(:key)... or set it directly
#     with UserVars.key = value -- do NOT redefine the class in a spec. A script
#     that needs a domain default (e.g. combat-trainer's moons) reopens
#     Harness::UserVars to add just that default (see combat_trainer_spec).
#   - If a .lic method calls exit on a guard, drive it with
#     `expect { ... }.to raise_error(SystemExit)` (or stub exit on the instance).
#     A stray unwrapped exit terminates the whole run, not just the example.
#
# Shared setup / why reset_data lives here (do not move it):
#   - This file is loaded before every spec via .rspec (--require spec_helper). It
#     loads the test harness, includes Harness at the top level, provides the
#     load_lic_class / load_lic_module / load_lic_constant / load_lic_methods
#     extraction helpers, and registers the single global before(:each)
#     { reset_data } hook.
#   - Do NOT register a global RSpec.configure { config.before } in a spec.
#     Same-scope before(:each) hooks run in the order they are registered, so a
#     config.before(:each) runs before a group's own before hooks only when it
#     was registered before that group was defined. spec_helper is required
#     first (via .rspec), so its single reset_data hook is registered before
#     every group and always runs first -- which is exactly why reset_data
#     belongs here, not in a spec. A config.before added inside a spec file is
#     registered AFTER the groups of already-loaded specs, so it runs AFTER
#     their before hooks and clobbers the per-example world (guild, settings,
#     hands, room) they set up (and it also runs for every example in every
#     other file). Put spec-specific world setup in a describe-scoped before
#     instead.

# Line ranges (0-based, inclusive) each extractor actually eval'd out of a .lic,
# keyed by absolute path. Lets the coverage backfill below distinguish "no spec
# ever eval'd this line" from "eval'd, but Ruby attributed the statement to a
# neighbouring line". Harmless and cheap when coverage is off.
LIC_EVAL_RANGES = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }

# Coverage (opt-in): COVERAGE=1 bundle exec rspec, report in coverage/index.html.
#
# This has to run before anything else here, and it needs `enable_coverage :eval`
# -- the .lic files are never required, they are eval'd by load_lic_class below,
# and Ruby only measures eval'd source when Coverage is set up with eval: true.
# Starting here is early enough: RSpec requires spec_helper (via .rspec) before
# it loads any *_spec.rb, so every load_lic_class call still lies ahead of us.

  # which quietly flatters the percentage. Backfill those lines from SimpleCov's
  # own static line classifier (the same one it uses for files that were never
  # loaded at all) so they land in the denominator as uncovered.
  #
  # Restricted to lines OUTSIDE every range an extractor eval'd. Inside an eval'd
  # range Ruby is authoritative and the static classifier is not: it calls each
  # element line of a multi-line literal relevant, while Ruby attributes the
  # whole literal to one line. Backfilling there invents missed lines for code
  # that demonstrably ran (astrology.lic's OBSERVE_SUCCESS_PATTERNS is the

# namespace -- so two scripts that each define a generically-named helper (e.g.
# `main`) simply get their own module instead of silently colliding by load
# order. `allow(mod).to receive(:foo)` stubs cleanly, including for sibling calls.

# Only column-0 `def`s are matched, so an instance method that happens to share
# a name inside a class earlier in the file is never lifted out by mistake.
#
# Instance-variable state: the returned module is a single object that lives for
# the whole process, so `Mod.foo` runs with `self == Mod` and any @ivar a def

# shown above. For a script whose defs read or write @ivars (e.g. heal-remedy.lic,
# jail-buddy.lic, trigger-watcher.lic), `include` the module in the describe block
# instead: the defs are plain instance methods, so they then run on the
# per-example RSpec instance -- `before { @ivar = ... }` reaches them and each
# example stays isolated for free.
#
# Limitations shared with the class/module extractors: the `^end` scan is
# defeated by a heredoc or string literal containing `end` at column 0, and a
# one-line or endless def (`def x; 1; end` / `def x = 1`) has no `^end` of its
